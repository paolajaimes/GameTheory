This repository houses a  game model simulation of interpersonal loans with informal enforcement, a key component of my ongoing research paper. The model simulates multiple borrower-lender pairings within an informal financial market framework.

At the heart of this simulation is the  calculation of the probability of a clash between each borrower and lender pair. This probability is determined based on several factors: the amount borrowed, the cost implications of a skirmish, and the associated costs for both the claimant and the debtor in the event of a clash.

My code not only evaluates these probabilities at an individual pair level but also extends to compute an aggregate probability of clash within the market.
